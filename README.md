# Email-Spam-Detection
This project develops a spam detection tool for SMS and email messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. 
Text preprocessing steps—such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming—prepare messages for classification. 
A TF-IDF vectorizer converts the cleaned text into feature vectors, which are analyzed by a trained machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes) to classify messages as "spam" or "ham." 
The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input a message in an interactive web interface, view results in real time, and reduce unwanted digital communication efficiently.
